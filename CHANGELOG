Fixes:
- Removed support for 'drop' effect because of IE problems. Possible fix for
  this issue caused black borders around transparent pngs in IE which further
  complicated fix. Removing support was best option for now. The original
  problem seems to be that the drop effect removes the element from DOM
  which IE is unable to restore on show(), the only way to restore it was to
  add 100% opacity in addition to calling show(), but this caused the black
  border problem.
