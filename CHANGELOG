1.4
New:
- Added easing in effectOptions which allows you to specify easing for the slide
  effect. Requires jQuery UI. Refer to the jQuery UI documentation for easing
  names (http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/#easing). You can also specify
  easing on an per item basis using itemControl which allows for different
  easing on each item. String value. Default: swing.
- Added slideVertical in effectOptions which allows for a vertical slide instead
  of horizontal. Boolean value. Default: false.

Fixes:
- Fixed slideBy value for itemControl, previously it would always pick the global
  value, ignoring the value in itemControl.

1.3
New:
- Added itemControl which allows you to specify effects, timers and other
  options on an per item basis.
- Added randomEffect, randomEffects, itemControl randomEffect,
  itemControl randomEffects. You can use randomEffect to get random effects on
  each rotation. Control which effects you want with the randomEffects array.
  randomEffect and randomEffects can also be specified on an per item basis
  using the new itemControl system, which allows for very fine-tuned item
  control.
- Added new effect, none (false), which allows pure CSS effects on items.
- Added debug and debugLevel, debug will output various debug data to the
  firebug console while with debugLevel you can control what type of debug
  data you want in the console.
- Added a test-suite to easier spot bugs during development.

Changes:
- Default effect was changed from fade to false (none).
- Renamed class to AdvancedListRotatorClass
- Renamed jQuery function to advListRotator
- Renamed file to advListRotator
- Renamed option listRotatorHelper to helper
- Default value for option activeItemClass changed to alrActiveItem
- Renamed option activeHelperItemClass to helperActiveItemClass
- Default value for option helperActiveItemClass to alrHelperActiveItem

Fixes:
- Corrected a bug in the shuffle function which caused the first rotation to end
  prematurely.

1.2
New:
- Added nextItemElement, nextItemElementInteraction, previousItemElement,
  previousItemElementInteraction to manually move forward and backwards in
  a list.

Fixes:
- Removed support for 'drop' effect because of IE problems. Possible fix for
  this issue caused black borders around transparent pngs in IE which further
  complicated fix. Removing support was best option for now. The original
  problem seems to be that the drop effect removes the element from DOM
  which IE is unable to restore on show(), the only way to restore it was to
  add 100% opacity in addition to calling show(), but this caused the black
  border problem.
